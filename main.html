            Once upon a time, during the dark ages on American politics. One hero emerged from a distance. His name was Donald. With his mighty rage against the Latin Americans and with his insane obsession with the Chinese, he crushed his enemies with his mighty hammer as they fled in terror. Not even one of them escaped that day.
